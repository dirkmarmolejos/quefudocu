Watch Movie and read Subtitles on Englando.com. This film was amazing. It felt like an extended Black Mirror episode with the structure of Crash (2004), but more about a theme of how distant, anonymous connections collide with intimate, familial ones (kind of). The acting, characters, writing, editing and directing were all excellent. It deserved a best picture nominee, and is certainly a lot better than Crash. There's a plot strand that I found far more moving and honest than the whole of Moonlight.

This was a very interesting movie. It feels like one of those movies that flies under the radar with a cast you wouldn't think of, or haven't heard of. This movie was a little slow to start, but that is okay, some movies need that time for proper character development. I think that happened here. Perhaps a few of the persona's were defined by a series of basic cliches. But for the most part, they are real cliches or stereotypes that exist.

Hey guys, I've compiled a list of movies that I haven't seen here (almost 200 last time I checked) and I was wondering which of the movies on my list should I watch first or put as a high priority. For each movie, I've decided to put in the year it was released and the length of each movie. Thanks for anyone willing to help, I just can't decide on which one I should start with. You can also add in your own suggestions unless I've already seen it. The list of movies are as follows: The Elephant. 
Disconnect interweaves multiple storylines about people searching for human connection in today's wired world. Through poignant turns Hi, first of all, I don't like comedy/sci-fi/crime/fantastic movies and don't want to watch a horror movie now. What's a good movie that takes you in its world, different lives? I watched Disconnect (2012) long ago and really loved it. I also liked Kill Your Darlings (2013) and Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2007). These are the ones I remember now. They are great dramas that's not trying to be funny but not even a little boring.

Anyway, the challenge is to watch and review 100 movies. Check. It also says to keep going after that, and review all of the new movies watched that year.
